Python code of my paper 'Timoshenko Beam Element with Anisotropic Cross-Sectional Properties' presented at
ECCOMAS Congress 2016, VII European Congress on Computational Methods in Applied Sciences and Engineering.
Crete Island, Greece, 5-10 June 2016

ABSTRACT:
Beam models are used for the aeroelastic time and frequency domain analysis of wind
turbines due to their computational efficiency. Many current aeroelastic tools for the analysis
of wind turbines rely on Timoshenko beam elements with classical cross-section properties (EA,
EI, etc.). Those cross-section properties do not reflect the various couplings arising from the
anisotropic behaviour of the blade material. A two-noded, three-dimensional Timoshenko beam
element was therefore extended to allow for anisotropic cross-sectional properties. For an
uncoupled beam, the resulting shape functions are identical to the original formulation. The
new element was implemented into a co-rotational formulation and validated against natural
frequencies and several static load cases of previous works.
